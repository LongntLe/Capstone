# Capstone

This repo contains the code and data for my MPCs as well as my implementation for a module for BitMEX sample-market-maker, which runs the Avellaneda & Stoikov model.

The organization of this repo is as follows:

- MPC: contains .py codes for MPC models, separated by model, as well as a Capstone .ipynb for interactive exploration with the MPCs.
- Past-papers: contains the implementation for the Avellaneda & Stoikov customed strategy to be run on BitMEX sample-market-maker.
- data: contains a small set of data to be used to demonstrate the model on real data. The data is collected on Kraken on August 1, 2019.
- others: contains license, code of conduct, and templates for the repo, as per Github policies.
